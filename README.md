# Drowsiness_detection
Drowsiness Detection Project aims to develop a system that monitors a userâ€™s alertness level, particularly while driving, and provides timely warnings to prevent accidents caused by fatigue or drowsiness. The system uses real-time video feed and machine learning algorithms to analyze facial landmarks, eye blink patterns.
